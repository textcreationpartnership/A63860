            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

If I have done it well, I have my wiſh; if not, at leaſt accept my endeavour. You were the firſt whoſe patience peruſed it, in a rough

            <p>IF the unuſual method of this little Treatiſe ſeem leſſe accommodated to Vulgar capacities (it being indeed the proper form of Schools) at leaſt I hope the matter wil ſo far pleaſe all, and ſuit with all, as to rectifie ſome miſtaken judgments, if not poſſeſſed with too much paſſion, prejudice, or intereſt. That which moved me to draw it in this form, was the deſired ſatisfaction of ſome judicious and ſtrong reaſoning friends, who could not perhaps have ſo eaſily been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to their own good by any long Rhetorical argumentation, as by this ſhort and ſyllogiſtical way. The wiſhed effect it wrought in them, gives me ſome hope, if ſeriouſly peruſed, it may alſo work the like in many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: the propoſed object of my weak endeavours.</p>
            <p>Finding it then agreed by all parties, that Chriſt our Lord hath
<pb facs="tcp:45808:4"/> founded and built a Church in his own blood, which was the onely Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris of divine faith, and ſole Repoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of all revealed Truths, at leaſt for an age or two: where can I better initiate my following Arguments, then from the Controverſies of the Church, the moſt important doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe of all others; ſince on the notion &amp; eviction of her Authority, all other points eſſentially depend, for their knowledge and deciſion? My firſt eſſay therefore ſhall be to prove the Roman Catholique Church to be the only true Church of God, by ſhewing all the moſt conſpicuous marks, and eminent properties of the Church, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned us by Chriſt himſelfe, to have been verified in her, and none but her. This done, I ſhall proceed to vindicate her particular and principal doctrines, wherein ſhe hath been moſt impugn'd by Sectaries.</p>

That the true Body and Bloud of Chriſt is in the Sacrament of the Altar, under the forms of Bread and Wine, the Bread being tranſubſtantiated by the Divine Power into the Body, and the Wine into the Blood. 4. That no man can make this Sacrament but a Prieſt, rightly ordained by the Keyes of the Church, which Jeſus Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf gave to the Apoſtles and their Succeſſors. 5. That Baptiſm profits little ones, as well as thoſe, who are of riper years unto ſalvation.</hi> Can. 1.</p>

                     <p>Finally, becauſe if private reaſon were the only Judg of controverſies, it would evidently follow, the General councils of all former ages, (which have commanded all perſons under pain of damnation to obey their definitions, and

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:45808:51" rendition="simple:additions"/> in all ages (which is a pregnant and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing proof of our ſecond Propoſition) is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt by the Chronicles and Martyrologies of the whole Chriſtian world.</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and his fellows, who convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed England, when they were received into Canterbury (ſaith <hi>Hollinſhed part 1. p.</hi> 100.) began to follow the trade of the Apoſtles, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing themſelves in continual prayer, faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, watching, and preaching, deſpiſing all worldly things, and living in all points ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the doctrine which they taught.</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Francis,</hi> S. <hi>Bennet,</hi> and S. <hi>Dominick,</hi> were all eminent for ſanctity of life, as the Magdebur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian Centuriſts confeſs, <hi>Centur. 13. col.</hi> 11. 79. but I never yet heard of any Proteſtant Saints in the world: Add hereunto what the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church teaches, That the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are poſſible, nay muſt be kept; ſhe teaches the neceſſity of contrition, confeſſion, and ſatisfaction, with many other penal pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes of ſelf-denial; ſhe teaches obedience to Prieſts and ſpiritual Paſtors, in things belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſoul, and the Government of the church; ſhe teaches much faſting, prayer, and mortification; ſhe exhorts to good works, voluntary poverty, chaſtity, and obedience.</p>
                  <p>The contrary to all which holy doctrines are taught by Proteſtants, and other Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:45808:51"/>
                  <p>Her churches are open, and divine Service ſaid not only on all Sundaies and Holy daies, but every day in the week, and that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part in the forenoon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There is five times more preaching and catechiſing, and ten times more faſting and praying in the Catholique Church, then in the Proteſtant; her Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are more and more frequented, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of an innumerable multitudes of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men and women that are in the Catholike Church, who have freely forſaken all things to follow Chriſt, and totally relinquiſh'd the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, pleaſures, and preferments of this life to ſerve him the remainder of their daies, in vows and practiſes of holy poverty, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and chaſtity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Proteſtants have an innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable company of Sects and Sectmaſters, that daily ſpring out of their ſtock, ſuch as are continually broaching new hereſies, and alwayes at defiance one with another.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>major,</hi> as to the power of miracles, is proved by theſe promiſes of Chriſt, <hi>He that believeth in me, the works that I do, he ſhall do, and greater,</hi> S.

                  <p>The <hi>minor</hi> is proved, becauſe, if the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were nothing but a ſacred ſigne, type, or figure only of <hi>Chriſts Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> (as Doctor <hi>Taylor</hi> teaches,) then the ſignes and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of the old Law were more excellent and noble then it.

So that an artificial corporal ſigne is ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like a ſubſtantial ſhadow; that is to ſay, a body without body; a ſubſtance without ſubſtance, a contradiction. His meaning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is, if he dare ſpeak it, that it is real and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial bread and wine, and a ſigne only, an artificial ſigne of the true body and blood of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which is notoriouſly falſe, as hath and ſhall be proved, for after conſecration it is no longer real and ſubſtantial bread and wine, but the real and ſubſtantial body and blood of Chriſt, under the outward formes of bread and wine, and in this ſenſe it may be truly cal'd the body and blood of <hi>Chriſt, really, ſubſtantially, corporally, verily and indeed;</hi> but

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob. The true body of Christ is therein effect, that is in order to al the effects and purpoſes of his death &amp; paſſion,</hi> which is enough to verifie his words.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is not; for ſo a counter is a pound of mony, when it ſtands for a pound on a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Arithmetick; So a mans writings are his Lands in effect, that is, in order to effects and purpoſes, yet no man well in his wits will ever ſay a counter is a pound of mony, or a mans writings his Lands, <hi>really, ſubſtantially, corporally, verily and indeed,</hi> theſe are as wild expreſſions as the former; cauſes are not their own effects, nor effects, cauſes, as every young Logician can tell you. Nor is there any war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in all the Goſpell, that a meere ſigne, type or figure of Chriſts body and blood, ſhould be his body in effect, or avaliable to us in order to all the benefits and effects of his paſſion, this is only <hi>gratis</hi> ſaid by the <hi>Doctor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> You urge yet out of <hi>S. Paul, that in
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:45808:83"/> Chriſt all the fulneſſe of the divinity is ſaid to dwel corporally.</hi> Therefore <hi>Chriſts body,</hi> and <hi>blood</hi> may be ſaid to be <hi>ſubſtantially and corporally in the Sacrament, ſigne, or figure only of his body and bloud.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I deny your conſequence; the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity is, 1. That all the ſubſtance, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Divinity is really and truly in Chriſt; whereas the ſubſtance and eſſence of the Body and Bloud of Chriſt is not at all in the Sacrament, ſigne or figure, according to your doctrine. 2. That all the ſubſtance and eſſence of the Divinity is in Chriſt hypoſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally united in one perſon with his humane nature, which conſiſts of a reall body and ſoul, and therefore by reaſon of that union of the natures, and communication of their proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the Divinity may be truly ſaid to dwell in him corporally. But there is no ſuch union of natures, or communication of properties, betwixt Doctor <hi>Taylors Sacrament,</hi> and the Body and Bloud of Chriſt: Therefore this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance comes not home to the purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Your laſt ſhift is (and this no better then the former) to tell us, <hi>That the body of Chriſt is only in the Sacrament, really ſpiritually, ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſpiritually, corporally ſpiritually,</hi> that is (ſayes he) <hi>the reality, ſubſtance, and body of Christ is in the Sacrament in the receivers ſpirit, by vertue of an act of faith, by which he believes it to be there.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> You ſtill dance in the ſame net of contradictions. No act of faith in the receiver can make the <hi>reality, ſubſtance, and veritie of Christs bodie and bloud to be there truly preſent, where it implies contradictions to be preſent,</hi> as you affirm it does in the Sacrament. If you believe it to be <hi>ſubſtantially</hi> and <hi>corporally,</hi> where it is impoſſible for his <hi>ſubstance</hi> and <hi>bodie</hi> to be, you feed your ſoul with a falſe faith. Where is it revealed to us in the Goſpel, that Chriſts bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is in the Sacrament by faith only? What Apoſtolical Tradition have you for it? or in what country did our Saviour teach it? The chapter and verſe could never yet be cited nor ever will; the land is yet unknown; 'tis a meer fiction: take but off the mask from theſe abuſive terms, which was firſt made by <hi>John Calvin</hi> at Geneva, but lately furbuſht up by D. <hi>Taylor,</hi> to carry on the diſguize, and you will clearly ſee the nakedneſs of his mock-Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, by the bright-ſhining lamp of thoſe plain words; <hi>This is my bodie; this is my bloud of the new teſtament, which is ſhed for many to the remiſſion of ſins, S.

The whole coat, or rather cloak, which he hath made for this divine and holy Body; or to ſay better, for his own deceiptful hereſie, is better in the trimming, then the ſtuffe, which argues him to be but a fallacious &amp; ſuperficial work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> You will play at ſmall game, rather then not be fencing againſt the truth; if this were ſo as you pretend, then nothing at all could ever be proved touching this point, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your grounds, who will admit no other Judge or Rule then Scripture only; and ſo the myſtery were quite deſtroid, and brought to a <hi>non liquet;</hi> but your antecedent is falſe, for though <hi>S. Paul</hi> thrice calls it <hi>Bread,</hi> yet he no where determines it to be natural or earthly bread, but the contrary. <hi>The bread</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which we break, is it not the participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the body of our Lord? 1. Cor. 10. 16. Let a man prove himſelf, and ſo let him eat of this bread, and drink of this cup; for he that eats and drinks unworthily, eats and drinks Judgment to himſelf, not diſcerning the body of our Lord. v.</hi> 28. 29.</p>
                     <p>Naturall and common bread is not a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of the body of Chriſt, it requires no ſuch examin of our ſelves to a worthy eating of it, nor can we be damned for not diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Body</hi> of our Lord in it, where it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is not. So that the very circumſtance of the text, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines the bread there ſpoken of to be that <hi>Heavenly bread</hi> promiſ'd in the ſixt of S. <hi>John.</hi> That bread which <hi>Paul</hi> tells you <hi>Christ</hi> took
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:45808:89"/> and made his body, ſaying, <hi>This is my body which ſhall be delivered for you, in the ſame, 6. v.</hi> 24. Therefore the balance is far from being equall; where the diſpute is, what it is <hi>Chriſt</hi> inſtituted; no other places whatſoever can counterbalance thoſe of the inſtitution, 'tis partial, and irrational, to ſay they can.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ob Chriſt</hi> ſaies, <hi>This is my body which is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for you</hi> (ſo <hi>the Greek text runs) 1. Cor.</hi> 11. Therefore he did not give his true natural <hi>Body</hi> in the Sacrament, becauſe that would not be there naturally broken.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> I grant your antecedent, but deny your conſequence; and for proofe I anſwer, that though his natural body be there, yet the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of its being is ſpiritual &amp; ſacramental, and the manner of its breaking follows the manner of its being. The Sacrament is broken naturally and properly, according to the ſpecies or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents of bread, but the <hi>body</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned under them is broken only by accident, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly, and ſacramentally. His body is there broken in the ſigne, not in the ſubſtance, and this ſufficeth to repreſent and ſignifie its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and proper breaking on the Croſs.</p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> The ſenſe of <hi>Tertullian</hi> is plain: His queſtion againſt <hi>Marcion</hi> was, whether Chriſts body were true and real, which he proves by this argument; That which is not true cannot have a figure, but bread is the figure of Chriſts body, therefore Chriſts body is true. Now this Father (as it is confeſſed by all) having a
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:45808:104"/> croſs manner of expreſſion, delivers himſelf in the words alledg'd, whoſe ſenſe is, that Chriſt, by ſaying, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> verified the ſaying of the Prophet, who had figuratively called his body bread; for bread could not be truly a figure, till there was made a body, whoſe figure it might be, which was then done. This he calls, <hi>that he gave bread the figure of his body,</hi> not meaning to that particular bread which he had taken in his hand, but the nature of bread, of which the Prophet ſpake, and by which he figur'd the body of our Saviour; So that if our Saviour had done nothing but cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the body his bread in words, he had done no more then the Prophet, and not fulfilled the figure of the Propheſie, but repeated it. But <hi>Tertullian</hi> will have us underſtand, that by theſe words of our Saviour, the nature of bread, which the Prophet ſpake of, got truly to be the figure of Chriſts body, to wit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſts body by theſe words became tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alimental to us, and therfore with great propriety to be figur'd by bread, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet had done. <hi>Tertullians</hi> argument there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpeaks of the figure which the Prophet made (which now began truly to be a figure) not of a new figure which our Saviour made. And by this you may underſtand that other place objected out of him, <hi>viz. The bread ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and diſtributed to his Diſciples he made his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:45808:104"/> by ſaying,</hi> This is my body; <hi>that is, a figure of my body,</hi> l. 4. cont. Marcion. c. 40. <hi>That Chriſt made bread his body,</hi> he plainly and poſitively affirms; how he made it his body, is no leſs plain, <hi>viz.</hi> by ſaying, <hi>this is my body;</hi> and that he made it likewiſe a figure, ſigne, or Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his body, is agreed upon by all: The difference is, that you would have theſe words, <hi>that is a figure of my body,</hi> relate to the predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, <hi>my body,</hi> whereas indeed they relate to the ſubject, <hi>hoc,</hi> or <hi>this,</hi> and make this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. <hi>This, that is, a figure of my body, is my body.</hi> Bread was a figure of his body in the old Law, and he made the outward form or accidents of bread, to be a figure, or Sacrament of his body in the new, at his laſt ſupper: Nor is this form of ſpeech unuſuall in him.

                     </p>
                     <p>You reply, though <hi>Jonas</hi> his ſoul may be ſaid to be ſenſibly ſwallow'd by means of his body in which it was, or by accident, yet it can no waies be ſaid to be ſenſibly eaten or chew'd. Therefore though <hi>Chriſts body</hi> be in the Sacrament, yet it cannot be ſaid to be ſenſibly chew'd or eaten in it, ſeeing the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of its being is ſpiritual.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> The diſparity is, that <hi>Ionas</hi> was not chew'd or eaten either according to his ſoul or body; But <hi>Chriſts body is ſenſibly chew'd or eaten in the Sacrament,</hi> according to the Signs or Sacrament, though not according to its own ſubſtance.</p>

                     <p>S. <hi>Pauls</hi> principal intent in his Epiſtle to the Hebrews, was to ſhew the Jews, that no ſacrifice of the old Law was general, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory for all ſin, or able to reconcile the whole world to God, as the ſacrifice of the croſs was; ſo that it had been impertinent for him to have diſputed there of the unblou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſacrifice of the Maſs, which is not of ſuch univerſal force or efficacy.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is proved, as to <hi>Poverty</hi> thus: <hi>If thou wilt be perfect, go and ſell all thou haſt, and give to the poor, and come and follow me, and thou ſhalt have treaſure in Heaven.</hi> Mat. 19. 21: <hi>The multitude of Believers had one heart, one ſoul, neither did any of them call ought their own of thoſe things which they poſseſsed,</hi> Acts 4. 32.

                  <p>As to <hi>Chaſtity,</hi> it is proved thus: <hi>There be Eunuchs who have gelded themſelves for the Kingdom of Heaven; he that can take, let him take.</hi> Mat. 19. 12. This was an actual councel of perpetual chaſtity, and imply's alſo a Vow, becauſe it ſignify's that ſome by one act of the will had cut off from themſelves all power of marrying, which could not be but by Vow, as the Fathers conclude on this place. St. <hi>Paul</hi> commands that young wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows ſhould not be choſen or admitted to the vow of widdow-hood: <hi>But the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger widdowes</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>avoyd, for when they
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:45808:187"/> ſhall be wanton in Chriſt, they will marry, having damnation, becauſe they have made voyd their firſt faith, 1 Tim.</hi> 5. 2. (that is, their vow of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity.) <hi>He that hath reſolved in his heart being ſetled, not having neceſſity, but having power of his own will, to keep his Virgin, doth well; therefore be that giveth his Virgin in marriage does well; and he that gives her not, does better, 1 Cor.</hi> 7. 37, 38. Add to this, that the Fathers (on thoſe words, <hi>How can this be, becauſe I know not man?</hi> St. <hi>Lu.</hi> 1. 34.) affirm and prove that the bleſſed Virgin Mary had vow'd chaſtity; otherwiſe ſhe might have known man, and have conceiv'd, and born a ſon without mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle.</p>
                  <p>As to <hi>Obedience</hi> thus: <hi>Children, obey your Parents in all things, Coloſ.</hi> 3. 20. And Chriſt himſelf was ſubject to the bleſſed Virgin and St. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> by a meer voluntary ſubjection; He himſelf being the abſolute Lord of them and all things. St. <hi>Luke 2. 51.

Iſa. 52. ſhake off the Fetters of the ſervitude; I mean the ſervitude of Schiſm and hereſie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That Monſter, Schiſm, which firſt, through the inſatiable luxury of an effeminate tyrant, broke the bonds of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and obedience in Gods Church, and has ſince (according to its proper quality) hatch'd an innumerable brood of Sects and Hereſies, which yet are daily ingendring more, and continually wander up and down in ſtrange unknown paths, and can never finde repoſe or ſettlement, whilſt they are out of Gods holy Arke, the <hi>Catholique Church;</hi> which alone has ſtood conſtant and immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able amidſt all thoſe changes and revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons theſe late unhappy yeers have produced: which alone yeelds true comfort and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to thoſe that rely on her Authority.</p>
               <p>Return then (my dear Countrey) to thy
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:45808:203"/> own true mother, and embrace the liberty of her ſaving Faith. This is the freedom I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite thee to: This is the happineſſe I wiſh thee: This is the way I have chalk'd thee out by the ſtrait line of Apoſtolical Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, a milky way, which leads ſoules to eternal beatitude. God of his mercy grant thou maiſt walk in it, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord and Saviour, to whom be all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory for ever.</p>

               <p>AFter I had finiſhed this <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> a learned friend ſent me a certain Britiſh teſtimony, taken out of Sir <hi>Hen. Spelman, de Concil. p.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>8. and out of it an Argument framed againſt the Popes power over the whole flock of Chriſt: and though it came not to my hands ſoon enough to be admitted to its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place, yet I thought good rather to adde it here, then not at all, leſt as it has deluded ſome, it might ſeduce others, if not called to a juſt trial.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Henry</hi> ſayes, he findes the Original Cambrian interlined with Engliſh in an old Manuſcript of <hi>Peter Moſton,</hi> a Cambrian Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman; copied ſo (if we may truſt Sir <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
                  <pb n="402" facs="tcp:45808:204"/> conjecture) out of another of more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity: and, to fit it for other Nations, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf tranſlates it into <hi>Latin,</hi> the Engliſh and Welſh remaining verbatim tranſcribed out of Mr. <hi>Moſtons</hi> pretended Copy; and ſo prints it in his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ook. When, and by whom that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript was compoſed, he profeſſes himſelf ignorant: but ſets down the teſtimony as the Abbot of <hi>Bangor's</hi> Anſwer to St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> the Monk, when he demanded of the Britans an acknowledgement of ſubmiſſion to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church: And affirms that this Abbot &amp; firſt Author of the Cambrian lines was the learned and renowned <hi>Dinoth</hi> or <hi>Dionoth;</hi> one of thoſe that, with the ſeven Britan Biſhops, gave meeting to St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in the ſecond Synod held at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> as ſome will have it, in the yeare of Chriſt 601. the firſt meeting (of fewer and meaner perſons) having been (as far as I can gueſſe by Hiſtory) not about <hi>Worceſter,</hi> as Sir <hi>Henry</hi> puts it, but in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of the <hi>Vectians</hi> (the Iſle of <hi>Wight</hi>) and <hi>Weſt-ſaxons.</hi>

               <p>That all may better diſcern the vanity of this objection, I will here ſet down the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, whence it's taken, word for word, and point for point, juſt as it lies printed in Sir <hi>Henries</hi> book, in the original Cambrian (which is chiefly or only to be regarded) and as tis tranſlated into Engliſh and Latin, thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>Though this Record be much inſiſted on by Sir <hi>Henry</hi> and others, more modern oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of the Roman Church, Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> in his Treatiſe of <hi>Schiſme,</hi> p. 112. and Dr. <hi>Bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hal,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Derry,</hi> as an argument lately found of great force, if not demonſtrative a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that power over the whole Church of Chriſt, which all Catholiks acknowledge the Popes right, by Chriſts inſtitution: yet how unapt it is for that purpoſe, how unworthily alleaged by perſons of any ordinary judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or erudition; and how eaſily convicted to be a ſimple impoſture, is cleerly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated by what follows.</p>
               <p>Firſt, there is not the leaſt ſcrap of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity ſo much as pretended to prove, that the Cambrian lines cited were the Abbot of <hi>Bangors</hi> anſwer to St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> upon the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſpecified; nor that the renowned <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noth</hi> was that Abbot; nor that the old Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript, whence <hi>Sir Henry</hi> extracts the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, was copied out of any other more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient: All theſe are but <hi>Sir Henries</hi> bare conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, without any proof at all. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, if his Manuſcript be no elder then the enterlined Engliſh, he hath groſly wronged himſelfe and his Reader, by honouring it with the ſtile of ancient: For, as every one
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:45808:206"/> ſees, the Engliſh is purely modern, &amp; cannot be ſo old by many years as <hi>Henry</hi> the eighths caſhiering the Popes authority, and arroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſupremacy in Eccleſiaſtical matters to himſelfe; for maintenance whereof it is alleaged, and was certainly forged.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Welſh lines are ſo un-Cambri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an for Orthography, ſo mixed with Engliſh words, and ſo juſt to the mode of the preſent Engliſh or other ſtrangers, writing imperfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as they are apt to ſpeak, when they are but young ſmatterers in that language, as every one but of indifferent skil therein can teſtifie, that it cannot be in the leaſt degree cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, either <hi>Dinoth</hi> or any other Abbot of <hi>Bangor</hi> ſhould be author of them.</p>

               <p>The Cambrian teſtimony being thus loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked into, it cannot be more credibly thought, that <hi>Dinoth,</hi> or any ancient Abbot of <hi>Bangor</hi> was the author of it, then it can be imagined that one, renowned for learning, and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated for an ancient writer (as <hi>Dinoth</hi> was) or one of ſpecial note above others for eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition (ſuch ſurely was the Abbot of <hi>Bangor</hi>) ſhould (1050 years ſince, when the language was pure, and the Britans commerce with the Saxons little, unleſſe it were to warre) in writing his native ancient language (which was the ſole idiom of his Countrey) uſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Engliſh words; or characters, which not his own, but the Engliſh Alphabet admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; or be inconſtant or diverſe in writing the ſame word; or fal juſt into ſuch errors of Orthography, as the Engliſh or other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful commonly doe at this day, when they write Cambrian: And whether this be not extreamly incredible and unlikely, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale to all rational judgements.</p>
               <p>But though all theſe exceptions, obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble only by the Britans, ſhould be winked at, and the teſtimony only confidered in its
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:45808:207"/> Engliſh and Latine tranſlation; yet is the Author thereof eaſily convicted to be an ignorant Impoſtor by his putting <hi>Bangor</hi> ſix or ſeven yeers after St. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> comming into <hi>England,</hi> under the government of the Biſhop of <hi>Caerleon</hi> upon <hi>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ske,</hi> to <hi>Meneuy,</hi> in King <hi>Arthurs</hi> time, by St. <hi>David;</hi> who (by Dr. <hi>Pits, de Illuſt. Britan. Script. de St. Davide</hi>) died about the yeer of Chriſt 544. which was fifty yeers before St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines</hi> firſt entrance into <hi>Britain:</hi> whereto Sir <hi>Henry</hi> himſelfe aſſents, putting that tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betwixt 70 and 80 years before St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtines</hi> comming.</p>
               <p>Was he not then an ignorant Impoſtor that put <hi>Bangor</hi> ſix or ſeven yeers after St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtines</hi> comming, under the Biſhop of <hi>Caer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon</hi> upon <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>sk?</hi> Is it likely, or poſſible that <hi>Dinoth</hi> (or any other Abbot of <hi>Bangor</hi> at that time) ſhould be ignorant of the aforeſaid tranſlation, or not know under what imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Biſhop or Metropolitan their famous
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:45808:208"/> Monaſtery was ſeated? <hi>Dinoth,</hi> I ſay, of all others, who is famous in the Catalogue of ancient Writers, (as for other Treatiſes, ſo particularly) for his defence of the juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the Sea of <hi>Menevy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To ſay with Sir <hi>Henry,</hi> that the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Menevy,</hi> even after the tranſlation, retained the title of <hi>Caerleon,</hi> is not worth regard. Firſt, becauſe it is but his word, without proof. Secondly, becauſe it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a contradiction, to ſay, the Sea was tranſlated, and the former title ſtil retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; Tranſlation importing, not a joynt poſſeſſion of two titles, but the taking a new, and a deſertion of the old.</p>
               <p>To all my former exceptions againſt the Teſtimony, adde, Firſt, that there is no like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood <hi>Dinoth,</hi> a writer of <hi>Latin</hi> books, or any other, that could either write <hi>Latin</hi> himſelfe, or get a Latin Secretary to help him, ſhould return a Welſh anſwer to St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> who (as all know) was an Italian, not many yeers before come from <hi>Rome,</hi> and cannot reaſonably be preſumed either to have underſtood the Britans native lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, or to have made his demand to them otherwiſe then in <hi>Latin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, that both the Engliſh, <hi>nor to be father of fathers: to be claimed, &amp;c.</hi> and the Latin, <hi>nec eſse patrem patrum: vindicari, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="411" facs="tcp:45808:208"/> are falſe tranſlations of the Cambrian: the true being, whom you name Pope, or <hi>father of fathers, &amp;c. quem vos nominatis Papam, vel patrem patrum, &amp;c.</hi> Nor is the Cambrian rightly tranſlated by Sir <hi>Henries</hi> paſſive <hi>vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicari;</hi> or Dr. <hi>Hammonds vendicari &amp; poſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lari;</hi> but by the active <hi>vendicare &amp; poſtulare, to claim</hi> and <hi>to demand.</hi> This legerdemain diſcovers the Reformers humour, to be ſtil corrupting what fals into their hands to help out their cauſe againſt the Roman Church: and an ill cauſe it muſt be, that needs ſuch ſhifts.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that (however it goes with the Cambrian) there is no good ſence either in the Engliſh, <hi>Nor to be the father of fathers, to be claimed, &amp;c.</hi> or in Sir <hi>Henries</hi> Latine, <hi>nec eſſe patrem patrum: vindicari, &amp;c.</hi> as every Reader may ſee. And this Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> if affected to ſincerity, ſhould rather have acknowledged, then uſe ſo much para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſtical liberty and addition of his own, to make a falſ tranſlation and ſenſleſſe words ſpeak his mind againſt the Pope.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> makes as much againſt the aym of the Proteſtant Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latick Reformers, I mean the late <hi>Kings ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,</hi> which Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> and others (to keep off the guilt of ſchiſm from themſelves) labour to ſupport, as againſt the Popes: for
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:45808:209"/> thoſe words, <hi>who is to overſee under God over us,</hi> make the Biſhop of <hi>Caerleon</hi> next to God over <hi>Bangor,</hi> and exclude the <hi>King</hi> as wel as the Pope.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, if Sir <hi>Henry</hi> and thoſe others that borrow out of him had been willing to ſee the truth themſelves, and communicate it faithfully to others; they would not have made reflections upon that upſtart <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> which appeared not til within theſe fifteen yeers, and then onely brought in by head and ſhoulders, to witneſſe againſt the Popes ſupremacy a hundred yeers after it was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from him, by their forefathers who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it: but upon that true antiquity, which, having endured the ſhock of almoſt a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeeres, Sir <hi>Henry</hi> hath delivered a little before, <hi>pag.</hi> 105. tranſcribed out of Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Bedes</hi> Hiſtory of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> l. 2. c. 2. wherein every one may read, that when St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> in his diſpute with the Britans, at the firſt meeting, demanded their conformity to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in the celebration of. <hi>Eaſter</hi> and <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> and that they would joyn with him in preaching the Goſpel to the Heathen <hi>Saxons,</hi> and could not otherwiſe incline them to it, he offered to try by <hi>miracle,</hi> whether he or they were in the right; whether he did wel in deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or they ill in refuſing: which, the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi>
                  <pb n="413" facs="tcp:45808:209"/> failing, he effectually performed, mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly giving ſight to a blind man: And when, in the ſecond meeting he found them ſtil refractory to his propoſals, he prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically foretold Gods revenge, which ſoon after fell upon them.</p>
               <p>That <hi>miracle</hi> and divine vengeance more then ſufficiently prove, that St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> ſent by the Pope, came in the Name of God, from a lawful authority; and that his demands of conformity to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in the points ſpecified, were good, and to be yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to by the Britans. Miracles, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per works of the Almighty, and proper ſeales of his Miſſives, being never wrought to confirm unlawful miſſions or falſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines. And were there no other excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt the Cambrian pretended Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, but that <hi>Miracle;</hi> it clearly evidences, that when, and by whomſoever it was firſt written, the Author was either very igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, or in a worſe error, and that there was more obedience due to the Pope from thoſe of <hi>Bangor</hi> and all other Chriſtians, then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by it.</p>
               <p>I wiſh the preſent refractory oppoſers of the Roman Church, and her Miſſionaries, ſent by the ſame Authority, to preach the ſame doctrine with St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> would
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:45808:210"/> reflect without prejudice on that <hi>miracle,</hi> and prediction of divine revenge: they are a ſeaſonable theame for the preſent Pulpit.</p>
